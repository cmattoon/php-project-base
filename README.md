## General

I created this to start off a new PHP site quickly. It's based on HTML5BP and uses SASS/Compass for stylesheets,
and largely unfinished until I get around to making the rest of the stuff more general. 


## Dependencies
I'm developing this on PHP 5.5, though I'm not targeting any particular version. Most of the HTML5BP stuff is left 
intact, but I don't use it personally. Feel free to delete it.

## Setup
If you don't see "Hello, World!" when you load index.php, you may need to change the permissions or ownership of the `tplcache` folder in order for compiled templates to be saved.
