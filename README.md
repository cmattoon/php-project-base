## General

I created this to start off a new PHP site quickly. It's based on HTML5BP and uses SASS/Compass for stylesheets,
and largely unfinished until I get around to making the rest of the stuff more general. 


## Dependencies
I'm developing this on PHP 5.5, though I'm not targeting any particular version. Most of the HTML5BP stuff is left 
intact, but I don't use it personally. Feel free to delete it.
